<p>The stone, which was <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/hypatia-ancient-alexandrias-great-female-scholar-10942888/\">named for</a> an ancient Egyptian female mathematician and astronomer, has always struck scientists as odd. It's super hard, but also brittle&nbsp;and fractured, and coated with a strange shine. It took 17 years for scientists to realize that&nbsp;it was formed beyond Earth&mdash;and that it doesn't match any known meteorite or comet categories. The new research took that work a step farther by looking at the stone's structure, starting with the elements it is made of.</p>

<p>\"When Hypatia was first found to be extraterrestrial, it was a sensation,\" co-author <a href=\"https://www.wits.ac.za/staff/academic-a-z-listing/a/marcoandreoliwitsacza/\">Marco Andreoli</a>, a geologist at the University of Witwatersrand, <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-01/uoj-ehs010918.php\">said in a press release</a>.&nbsp;\"But these latest results are opening up even bigger questions about its origins.\"</p>
